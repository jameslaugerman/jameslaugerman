        <div class="container">
            <p>I'm James Laugerman, husband to the most amazing and beautiful wife in the world and father of 5. I live in central Des Moines, and am a proud graduate of Iowa State University.</p>
            <p>I started my career as a music director for a church in Iowa City in 2012. For the next 8 years, I helped that church grow, as well as help launch two other churches in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. Through that experience, I grew tremendously
                in my leadership, communication, and ability to constantly adapt to changing situations and technology. I learned how to connect with a diverse group of people, as well as how to motivate a team towards a common goal. I learned how to
                work with limited resources and maximize their potential. </p>
            <p>The world of music, like the world online, was always changing, and I took pride in making I was never a part of something <em>boring</em>. Music, like a website, is a creative work of art, and should capture one's attention. Also, like music,
                there is power in simplicity, and there is also beauty in innovation and complexities that make a piece unique. Both can be equally effective in the right context.</p>
            <p>In the world of web development, I want to help individuals and small businesses take pride in their online presence. I want them to feel like their website is <em>their own</em>, not just something from a drag and drop template. I want their
                web application to synchronize with whatever mediums they prefer using, whether it be online payment systems they are already using or a live look into what is happening on their social media pages. Bottom line, I want to create something
                that looks amazing, works intuitively, and is adaptable to whatever changes life brings.</p>
            <p>Let's start a conversation, and see how we can transform your vision into a reality.</p>
